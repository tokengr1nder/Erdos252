# Proof outline

Author: Tokengrinder

For every natural number \(k\), the theorem proves that
\[
\alpha_k=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sigma_k(n)}{n!},
\qquad \sigma_k(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}d^k,
\]
is irrational.

## Positive exponents

Fix \(k\ge1\). If \(\alpha_k\) were rational, the factorial tails
\(T_n=n!\sum_{m>n}\sigma_k(m)/m!\) would be integers for all sufficiently large \(n\).

1. **Expand the tails.** Expand the first \(k+1\) factorial denominators in reciprocal powers using Stirling numbers. Pairing complementary divisors gives a square-root growth bound. Together with a geometric estimate of the omitted tail, this makes the expansion error \(O_k(n^{-3/2})\).

2. **Align shifted arguments.** Construct a fixed finite grid of pairwise-coprime integers \(p_e\), offsets \(t_e\), and integer binomial weights \(w_e\). The Chinese remainder theorem supplies a progression of common arguments \(N\) with \(N\equiv t_e\pmod{p_e^2}\). For \(n_e=(N-t_e)/p_e\), multiplicativity converts \(\sigma_k(p_e)\sigma_k(n_e+h)\) to \(\sigma_k(N+hp_e-t_e)\). The \(p_e\) need not be prime.

3. **Cancel the large terms.** In each matching grid direction, the shift stays fixed while the multiplier is a polynomial of degree at most \(k\). An order-\((k+1)\) finite difference cancels that polynomial exactly. The weighted tail is therefore an integer tending to zero, hence eventually zero. The stronger error estimate then forces a finite signed combination
\[
R(N)=\sum_i c_i\,\rho_k(N+r_i)\longrightarrow0,
\qquad \rho_k(m)=\frac{\sigma_k(m)}{m^k}.
\]

4. **Contradict the remaining limit.** One shift \(r_*\) occurs exactly once and has nonzero coefficient. The actual progression mean is
\[
\mu_Q(a)=\sum_{\substack{d\ge1\\\gcd(d,Q)\mid a}}
 \frac{\gcd(d,Q)}{d^{k+1}}>0.
\]
Refine the progression using a fresh prime \(L\), larger than the modulus and all shifts. One residue misses every shift; another hits only \(r_*\). Their means of \(R\) differ by the nonzero quantity
\(c_*\mu_Q(A+r_*)L^{-k}\). Both means would have to be zero if \(R(N)\to0\), a contradiction.

The mean calculation includes \(k=1\): it uses summable domination of averaged divisor counts, not an unjustified uniform bound.

## Exponent zero

Divisor pairing directly gives \(0<T_n=O(n^{-1/2})\). Such tails cannot be eventually integral. This completes the case \(k=0\).
